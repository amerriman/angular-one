++To include things like the card images you need to include the following at the end of the body :
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.10/angular-sanitize.js"></script>

  THEN, at the top in the [], include "ngSanitize"

  THEN use ng-bind-html with the ng-repeat.  This works with html stuff (can include '<h1>HI</h1>')
